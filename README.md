# FBA-Bots

Fight back against bots is a project dedicated to auto reporting bot accounts plaguing the youtube comments sections. I may expand this to work with other platforms, however the focus is on youtube for now.

The user will not have to do anything, this is going to be an extension that scrapes the data from the comment section.

Current Plan:

The bot will scrape comments,
If a message is repeated multiple times, includes foul/racist words, or if a certain account is spamming, it will automatically be reported.
